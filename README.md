This system utilizes Matlab for facial recognition by employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
and Arduino to control the gate hardware, ensuring secure and efficient access control. 

The system captures an image of the person at the gate using a camera. 
This image is then sent to Matlab, where it undergoes preprocessing, such as resizing 
and normalization, to prepare it for analysis. The preprocessed image is fed into the CNN model, 
which has been trained to recognize and verify faces. The CNN model analyzes the image and 
compares it to a database of authorized faces.
If the face is recognized and matches an authorized individual, Matlab sends a signal to 
the Arduino microcontroller. The Arduino, acting as the control unit, receives this signal 
and activates the gate mechanism to grant access. This integration of Matlab's powerful 
image processing capabilities and Arduino's versatile hardware control ensures a robust 
and reliable gate access control system.

This system provides high accuracy in facial recognition, real-time processing for quick access, 
and scalability by adding more faces to the database and retraining the CNN model.
